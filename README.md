# FudanCourseKiller

This script is only designed for the old Fudan Course Selection System. It does not support the new system.

## Usage

This script is designed to run with iMacros under Firefox. To get it start working,You need to:

1.  Log in the course selection system

2.  Switch to `View Available Courses` panel

3.  Fill in the __CORRECT__ capcha code. If you are not sure it's correct, refresh the page until you feel sure

4.  Fill in the course number you want to get and click `Inquire`

5.  Fill in the same course number into `Inquire course number` and `Course number` in the left panel

Now, start running `GetCourse.js` in iMacros, and __DONâ€˜T__ leave this page.

When the available course is released, you should see a `Course Added` if it got the course. Otherwise you will see some other message.

# Advantages

-  Does not trigger System Busy error
-  Simple but very efficient and powerful
-  More than 90% chance to get a really hot course with only one place left

# Drawbacks

-  No automatic capcha killer (hard to implement with only using js)
-  Does not support getting multiple courses in one round (due to no capcha killer)
